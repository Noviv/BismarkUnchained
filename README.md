# BismarkUnchained

BismarkUnchained is a 2D top-down endless shoot-em-up with the primary
goal simply to get as far as possible. The player has access to a primary
gun - a laser/bullet-like object - that damages enemies on hit. This
weapon can be upgraded throught the "Upgrades" menu, which gives access
to stat upgrades in exchanged for level points. Level points are earned
by killing enemies - the more enemies, the more points, the more levels,
the more abilities. Enemies have access to the same array of weapons and
spawn in procedurally generated swarms, with larger, more difficult swarms
spawning as the player gets to higher levels. This means stat upgrades and
abilities must be used to progress past a certain level. On top of that,
a boss may spawn at intervals to make the game that much more difficult.

Beyond core game design and gameplay, our core features is time dilation -
the current speed of the game makes higher levels hard to navigate due
to the nature of keyboard-based acceleration. The bullet-hell feeling
is hard to avoid and at times the player may wish to slow down time,
strategize, and aim properly. This can be accomplished by using the
scroll wheel to manipulate the speed of time in the game. This does
not change the rate at which enemies spawn, so the player cannot simply
stay at the slowest speed, but it does give the player time to form a
strategy and move more accurately.
